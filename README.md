CE Wrapper is a wrapper to generate CloudEvents events for services that do not emit events themselves.
It will initially work for RESTful APIs.

It is a completely stateless proxy that passes the request unmodified to the downstream service, and emits an event for requests that are of interest. 

Default these are requests that change state, like POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE, but other methods can be added.

The mandatory cloud event context attributes are set using the information of the incoming http request, or with values set by the user. This way ample information is available for filtering and subscribing.

Context Attributes
- id, will be set with an autogenerated UUID
- source, needs to be configured
- subject, the path of the request
- type, this value will be a configured prefix follow by the methodname and the suffix *_handled*
- time, the time the forwarded request finished
- datacontenttype, the content type of the response from the downstream service
- dataschema, can be configured

The data will contain a json struct with the response body the downstream service returned. 

**Example**

Assume the downstream service is on `service.example.com` and it returns json formatted responses with person information.

A successful post request to `http://service.example.com/persons/id12345` resource that contains persons will result in an event with the following attributes.

- subject: `/persons/id12345`
- type: `com.example.persons.post_handled`
- source: `http://service.example.com/`
